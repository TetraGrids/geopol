# Geopol Data Lists for Web4 Systems üåê

Geopolitical data and utilities for building web3 applications with geographic and spatial capabilities.

This toolkit provides country, state, and city data along with scripts to generate hierarchical geographic directory structures. Useful for dapps, maps, NFTs, and other projects needing geolocation and geopolitical data.

## Current Tools

- `directory_maker` - Shell scripts to generate hierarchical geographic directory structures. Creates a folder structure for each country and state for the entire planet.
- `database_maker` - PHP scripts to generate a MySQL database of country and top level administrative division data. Works with this [json repo](https://github.com/dougbutner/gadm_geojson_data) to create a database of country and state data.
